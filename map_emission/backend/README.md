# Setup Backend Environment
In order to get backend running, you must have Python installed on your device. You then must install dependencies by doing firstly **python -m venv venv** to setup the environment,
then follow that with **.\venv\Scripts\activate** for Windows or **source venv/bin/activate** for MacOS/Linux. Then finally install Flask by using **pip install Flask**. You will also need to
install CORS by doing **pip install Flask-CORS**.
